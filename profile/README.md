## What We Do

Netnea provides professional services for web application security, focusing on:

- **[ModSecurity](https://www.modsecurity.org)** integration and optimization
- **[OWASP CRS](https://coreruleset.org)** deployment and tuning
- False positive analysis and remediation
- WAF rule development and customization

## Key Contributions

### CRS development

Netnea's Christian Folini ([dune73](https://github.com/dune73)) and Franziska Bühler ([franbuehler](https://github.com/franbuehler)) have both been CRS developers for more than 10 years. The concept for Paranoia Levels and the Regex disassembly that is at the base of the modern SQLi and XSS rules are contributions by Christian and Franziska.

### C-Rex

A suite of tools that helps with the operation of a CRS based web application firewall. C-Rex helps with the identification and tuning of false positives. It filters away all the attacks and shows you the false positives that can then be handled accordingly. C-Rex significantly reduces the time needed for repetitive log analysis and tuning.
